### Rationale

**Hexagonal Architecture** provides superior benefits over traditional layered approaches:
- **Testability**: Business logic can be tested in isolation without infrastructure dependencies
- **Flexibility**: Infrastructure components can be replaced without affecting core business rules  
- **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries reduce cognitive load and prevent architectural erosion
- **Evolution**: New features can be added without disrupting existing functionality
- **Domain Focus**: Business rules are the center of the architecture, not an implementation detail

**Dual Database Design** separates operational and audit concerns for:
- **Performance**: Optimized operational queries without audit overhead
- **Compliance**: Dedicated audit trail for regulatory requirements
- **Security**: Audit logs protected from operational data modifications
- **Backup Strategy**: Independent backup policies for different data types

## 6. Constraints & Risks

### Constraints

| Constraint                    | Implementation Approach                                   |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Simulated locker hardware     | LockerAdapter with realistic simulation and testing      |
| Production-ready deployment   | Docker containerization with nginx and SSL certificates  |
| Modern Python compatibility   | Python 3.12+ with timezone-aware datetime handling      |
| Campus-scale deployment       | SQLite-based design optimized for institutional use      |

### Risks

| Risk                          | Mitigation Strategy                                       | Likelihood |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Database performance issues   | Dual database design, SQLite WAL mode, query optimization| Medium     |
| Concurrent access problems    | Repository pattern with proper transaction handling      | Low        |
| Email delivery failures       | Comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms        | Medium     |
| Security vulnerabilities     | Multi-layer security, audit trails, comprehensive testing| Low        |
| System maintenance complexity | Automated monitoring, backup systems, admin tools        | Low        |
| Architectural drift          | Hexagonal architecture with clear boundaries and testing | Low        |

**Additional Risk Considerations**:
- **Scale limitations**: SQLite-based design suitable for campus-scale but may need migration for larger deployments
- **Email dependency**: System relies on email for notifications (mitigated with comprehensive error handling)
